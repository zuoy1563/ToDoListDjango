# Tips
  - Title length should be 1-50 characters
  - Description length should be 1-500 characters
  - While inputing dates, please follow the parttern "yyyy-MM-dd" (will improve later!)
  - Start date should be ealier than the end date (of course)
  - Start date should be today or later
  - Since the end date is the estimated date, it is allowed that items is not completed even after the end date. In this circumstance, the font color of the end date will turn red and be appended with "(Over Due)"
  - All items, completed items or not complted items can be shown respectively according to user selection
  - The background color of the "status" cells of completed items will turn green, otherwise it will be red

# To Be Improved
  - Allow users to mark completed items back to not completed
  - UI enhancement (e.g. calendar)
  - Ask for confirmation
  - Write test cases

# Comments
This was my first time to write Django project so that I had been confused during the whole development process. Too many things I have to learn, so that I did should thank Mr. Google, who helped me alot. Django was completely new to me, but fortunately, I finally worked this project out although it still can be improved (and I will!).
